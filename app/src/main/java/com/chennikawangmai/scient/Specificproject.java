This washing machine can work under both mechanical as well as electric power, thereby making it a highly useful commercial product; especially in rural areas where we donâ€™t have electricity all the time. It works by converting the linear force which is supplied mechanically, into rotational force in order to make the clothes inside move whilst simultaneously forcing dust particles out. The mechanical principle of its working is like that of a sewing machine. It can also work on electrical energy like that of a normal washing machine but the major point in favor of our dual power machine is that it being smaller can also be easily portable. In the presence of electricity, the rotor which is attached externally to the washing machine rotates and hence causes the clothes (which are either directly in contact with the main rotor or due to the swirling movement of water) to rotate. Due to centrifugal force in that rotating frame of reference, the dirt molecules from the clothes get detached, completing the cleansing action.");

The objective of V-Rex is to provide a low-cost and sturdy alternative to the existing devices.

The team constantly looks at building better vehicles as the years roll by, to push the performance and durability of the vehicle to the limit. Last year, they've come up with one of their best creations so far, the PSI Mirage. This vehicle has involved a lot of advanced fabrication techniques, to ensure no compromise on the quality. A lot of credit is due to Scient, where quality fabrication facilities were present, 24 cross 7 throughout the year. The Mirage brought us glory by bagging the first place in Acceleration at the Enduro Student India, while also putting us at a respectable 16th in the event. The team also bagged 6th overall in the Sales Presentation event at the BAJA SAE India, Indore. This year, the team is working even harder to build a much better creation, keen to make a larger mark at both the events.");
